10) Show the output produced by each of the following program fragments.
Assume that i and j are int variables.

a)

```c
i = 6;
j = i += i;
printf("%d %d", i, j);
```
=> 12 12

b)

```c
i = 5;
j = (i -= 2) + 1;
printf("%d %d\n", i, j);
```
=> 3 4

c)

```c
i = 7;
j = 6 + (i = 2.5);
printf("%d %d\n", i, j);
```
=> 2 8

d)

```c
i = 2; j = 8;
j = (i = 6) + (j = 3);
printf("%d %d\n", i, j);
```
=> Compiler warning: operation on ‘j’ may be undefined
   We have 2 cases:
      1) 6 9
      2) 6 14
